# Customer Segmentation Using Cluster Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using cluster analysis. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to tailor marketing strategies effectively.
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), application of clustering algorithms, and validation of the results.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values.
   - Identify and treat outliers.
   - Scale and normalize the data to prepare it for clustering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Summarize key characteristics of the data.
   - Visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.
   - Identify potential features for clustering.

### 3. Clustering
   - Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means.
   - Experiment with different numbers of clusters and evaluate their performance.

### 4. Cluster Validation
   - Use metrics like the Silhouette score to assess the quality of the clusters.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster.

### 5. Reporting and Visualization
   - Create visualizations to represent cluster distributions and characteristics.
   - Develop reports and dashboards to present findings and actionable insights.

### 6. Impact Analysis
   - Analyze the effectiveness of marketing strategies on different customer segments.
   - Measure engagement and sales data to validate the impact of segmentation.
